### Abstract

Self-assembly is a process whereby individual robotic units, without centralized control, autonomously organize into desired structures or patterns to achieve complex tasks. Its significance in the literature appears to be awaiting further exploration, as it has not quite reached its pinnacle or received the level of formal recognition it deserves. One aim of this master thesis is to provide a comprehensive understanding of self-assembly mechanisms, beginning with a detailed examination of its definitions, properties, and historical advancements, as outlined in related literature. Additionally, this thesis aims to advance the field through experimental research for further validating the feasibility of self-assembly mechanisms. Through rigorous analysis of the experimental outcomes, we aim to offer valuable insights that can enrich the existing body of knowledge in this area. Furthermore, we aim to lay the groundwork for potential future developments, thereby fostering continued exploration and expansion of the research started in this thesis.
